Fuck Twitter NFTs - Userscript to delete or block all occurances of NFT Users on Twitter 

Userscript will by default, attempt to delete tweets with NFT Avatars from timeline, if BlockingMode is set to 1, will actively try and block them, currently only works on timeline tweets though.

Tested on Firefox 98.0a1 (2022-01-15) with Tampermonkey 4.13.6136.


this is more of a learning excercise on my part, you should probably use something more popular that's less likely to break.

## [install here](https://github.com/Blumlaut/FuckTwitterNFTs/raw/main/FTNFTs.user.js)

Change `BlockingMode` from 0 to 1 to actively block accounts that have NFT Avatars
